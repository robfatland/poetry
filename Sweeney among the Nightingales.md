Sweeney among the Nightingales<br>
BY T. S. ELIOT

Apeneck Sweeney spread his knees<br>
Letting his arms hang down to laugh,<br>
The zebra stripes along his jaw<br>
Swelling to maculate giraffe.<br>
<br>
The circles of the stormy moon<br>
Slide westward toward the River Plate,<br>
Death and the Raven drift above<br>
And Sweeney guards the hornèd gate.<br>
<br>
Gloomy Orion and the Dog<br>
Are veiled; and hushed the shrunken seas;<br>
The person in the Spanish cape<br>
Tries to sit on Sweeney’s knees<br>
<br>
Slips and pulls the table cloth<br>
Overturns a coffee-cup,<br>
Reorganised upon the floor<br>
She yawns and draws a stocking up;<br>
<br>
The silent man in mocha brown<br>
Sprawls at the window-sill and gapes;<br>
The waiter brings in oranges<br>
Bananas figs and hothouse grapes;<br>
<br>
The silent vertebrate in brown<br>
Contracts and concentrates, withdraws;<br>
Rachel née Rabinovitch<br>
Tears at the grapes with murderous paws;<br>
<br>
She and the lady in the cape<br>
Are suspect, thought to be in league;<br>
Therefore the man with heavy eyes<br>
Declines the gambit, shows fatigue,<br>
<br>
Leaves the room and reappears<br>
Outside the window, leaning in,<br>
Branches of wistaria<br>
Circumscribe a golden grin;<br>
<br>
The host with someone indistinct<br>
Converses at the door apart,<br>
The nightingales are singing near<br>
The Convent of the Sacred Heart,<br>
<br>
And sang within the bloody wood<br>
When Agamemnon cried aloud<br>
And let their liquid siftings fall<br>
To stain the stiff dishonoured shroud.<br>
<br>
